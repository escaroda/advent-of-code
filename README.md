I've decided to practice Go this year. I wish I could learn Lua and Zig too, but can't handle both at the same time. Maybe next year?

Runtime: go version go1.22.3 linux/amd64

JavaScript madness and coming of age in separate repositories.

## 2015

"To the roots" or get my Python mastery back. I also try to avoid premature optimization for readability.

Runtime: Python 3.12.3
